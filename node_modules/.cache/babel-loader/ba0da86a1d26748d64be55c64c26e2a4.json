This could mean it fell into water or simply that it was exposed to a damp environment. Most items have a sensor that is triggered when exposed to water. To check for water damage, we take a look at this sensor and if it is triggered, we consider the phone water damaged.</p>\n\n                            <p><strong>Will Cash my device  still offer me money if my phone is water damaged?</strong></p>\n\n                            <p>For <strong>iPhones</strong> , Cash my device  <strong>will</strong> make an offer for water damaged phones, but the phone is considered \"broken\".</p>\n\n                            <p><strong>For all other cell phones brands</strong> with water damage, your offer <strong>will be</strong> significantly affected by a tripped water damage indicator and your offer could be reduced to $0.00.</p>\n\n                            <p>Either way, if we find that your phone is water damaged, we will notify you of a change in offer and allow you to choose the new offer or have the phone shipped back to you.</p>\n\n                            <p><strong>How to determine if your phone is water damaged:</strong></p>\n\n                            <p>Many water damaged phones still appear to be in full working condition, but the indicator sticker being tripped typically will change the value we can offer since it may signal internal corrosion that will cause problems down the road.</p>\n\n                            <p>To determine if your cell phone's water damage indicator has been tripped, you can perform a simple check before creating an offer with Cash my device . First, power down your phone. Next, remove the battery panel, and the battery itself. There will be a white dot on the phone itself, behind the battery. In some instances, the water damage indicator will be on the battery itself, or even on both the phone and battery.</p>\n\n                            <p>If the water damage indicator is WHITE, this means the phone is not water damaged.</p>\n\n                            <p>If the water damage indicator is PINK or RED, this means the water damage indicator has been tripped.</p>\n\n                            <p>In addition to the popularity of the iPhone, we receive a high number of Samsung phones. The Samsung water damage indicator is slightly different than the indicator statuses listed above (White, Pink/Red). We have created a video for you to follow to show you what a water damage indicator looks like in tripped status, as well as untripped status for Samsung phones.</p>\n\n                            <p>Samsung Water Damage Indicator Video: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgnx_zoaIk0\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgnx_zoaIk0</a></p>\n\n                            <p>If your phone is not an iPhone, and not a Samsung phone, and you are still uncertain if your water damage indicator has been tripped, we recommend checking with the manufacturer.</p>\n\n                            <p>Thank you!</p>\n\n                        </div>\n\n\n\n                    </Typography>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion expanded={expanded === 'panel14'} onChange={handleChange('panel14')}>\n                <AccordionSummary\n                    expandIcon={<ExpandMoreIcon />}\n                    aria-controls=\"panel1bh-content\"\n                    id=\"panel1bh-header\"\n                >\n                    <Typography className={classes.heading}>\n                        Are the contents insured against loss or damage?\n                    </Typography>\n                </AccordionSummary>\n                <AccordionDetails>\n                    <Typography>\n                        <div>\n\n                            <p>As long as you use the shipping label provided by Cash my device , in almost all cases your package will be insured on the way to our facility.</p>\n\n                            <p>Here is what you should know:</p>\n\n                            <p>Do not use a DropBox - We are not able to insure a package against loss if an item is not handed directly to a FedEx or USPS employee. We request and strongly suggest that customers do not use a FedEx or USPS Drop Box. Using a Drop Box of any kind could cause 2-4 weeks of delayed shipping, and if never recovered, could result in the denial of the Lost in Shipping claim.</p>\n\n                            <p>Pack your box carefully - Based on our extensive experience with shipping and carriers, we highly recommend that customers take the highest care to pack electronics very carefully. If you are packing your own box, we also highly recommend extra secure closure of the package around each edge to prevent any potential tampering, water exposure, dust exposure, or ripping of the box. Shipping carriers will deny a damage claim if the package is not properly packed. The claim will be denied if the item(s) are shipped in a flimsy box, or if not enough packing material is used to protect the contents. If you have any concerns about how well you will be able to pack an item, or multiple items, we strongly recommend using a packing service.</p>\n\n                            <p>Record the serial number of your device - We encourage customers to record the serial numbers of the devices in transit prior to shipment, or even snap a few photos for your records. If a damage or loss claim is the only route available in an unexpected situation, it is very helpful to have this information ready</p>\n\n                            <p>We will do whatever we can to help you recover your device or help you with a claim should the unfortunate happen. Our boxes are designed to take a lot, but if you have to pack something yourself, please follow the advice above.</p>\n\n                        </div>\n\n\n                    </Typography>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n\n            <Accordion expanded={expanded === 'panel15'} onChange={handleChange('panel15')}>\n                <AccordionSummary\n                    expandIcon={<ExpandMoreIcon />}\n                    aria-controls=\"panel1bh-content\"\n                    id=\"panel1bh-header\"\n                >\n                    <Typography className={classes.heading}>\n                        Which types of electronics does Cash my device  buy?\n                    </Typography>\n                </AccordionSummary>\n                <AccordionDetails>\n                    <Typography>\n\n                        <div>\n                            <p>Cash my device  buys many types of Apple devices, Apple Macbooks, Samsung devices, and other Android products.

After the 5 days passes, we have to assume you do not object to the new offer, and your device will be <strong>automatically processed</strong> under the new amount.

If you submit a \"Decline\" decision, we will return the device to you within 3 business days. You will receive an email with a tracking number, which will allow you to prepare for the item's delivery. <strong>NOTE: Return packages are not insured against</strong>  <strong>loss or theft</strong>  <strong>and do not require a signature.

An MEID ( <strong>M</strong> obile <strong>E</strong> quipment <strong>ID)</strong> and ESN uniquely identify a CDMA cellphone. In the 2005 time frame, the MEID began to replace the 32-bit ESN. An IMEI ( <strong>I</strong> nternational <strong>M</strong> obile <strong>E</strong> quipment <strong>I</strong> dentity) is unique number assigned to a GSM, UMTS or IDEN cellphones.</p>\n\n                            <p>An ESN, IMEI or MEID may be active for the following reasons:</p>\n\n                            <p>The device still holds an \"Active\" account status with the carrier</p>\n\n                            <p>The account associated with the device has an outstanding balance</p>\n\n                            <p>The device has been reported as lost or stolen</p>\n\n                            <p>This number is tied to a carrier and helps record the activity and status of the device. Prior to our inspection, we will check to ensure that the ESN has been deactivated.</p>\n\n                            <p><strong>If the ESN is not clear for activation</strong> , we will notify you via email and hold the item for <strong>5 days</strong>. To clear and active number, you must contact your wireless service provider and clear any issues that are causing your item's ESN to be active so that we can complete the evaluation process.After this hold period expires, we will issue a revised value for your phone in \"parts only\" condition. You will have another 5 days to decide if you would like to Accept or Decline the revised offer.</p>\n\n                            <p><strong>Helpful Hint -</strong> You may need this number as a reference. On many phones you can find your ESN, MEID or IMEI by typing in *#06# and your phone and the number will appear on your screen.</p>\n\n                            <p>Verizon phones can now be checked through their \"Activate Phone or Device\" page.

Once you place a device trade in order, your points earned will be shown in your rewards account with an “pending” status. Until these points are released from hold, you will not be able to redeem or use these individual points.  For Trade In orders to Cash my device  reward points are released from their “pending” state after your device has been inspected and paid for or will be dropped after 60 days from the time you place your order if your trade in device has not been received and inspected by Cash my device . For any points you redeemed to receive a bonus on your trade in, prior to your canceled device trade in will be returned to your Rewards Account.\n      </p>\n                            </li>\n                        </ol>\n\n                    </Typography>\n                </AccordionDetails>\n            </Accordion>\n            <Accordion expanded={expanded === 'panel62'} onChange={handleChange('panel62')}>\n                <AccordionSummary\n                    expandIcon={<ExpandMoreIcon />}\n                    aria-controls=\"panel1bh-content\"\n                    id=\"panel1bh-header\"\n                >\n                    <Typography className={classes.heading}>\n                        Can I send more than one item in the same box?\n\n                    </Typography>\n                </AccordionSummary>\n                <AccordionDetails>\n                    <Typography>\n                        <div class=\"page_body\">\n                            <p>Yes, but please make sure you identify which device belongs to which offer by securing the \"PS\" number to the device.</p>\n\n                            <p>If you have 2 or more transactions on different orders and would like to ship them using one box, we recommend securing each packing slip to it's respective device.

In nearly all cases, these security safeguards can only be removed by the registered or original owner of a computer. These protocols are in place for your protection in examples such as the application \"Find My Mac\", but can pose a problem during inspection or for a new owner.</p>\n\n                            <p>Additionally, we strongly recommend backing up any product keys and following the deauthorization procedures for other software vendors. This can include vendors such as <em>Adobe, Microsoft, Avid</em>, or any other software associated with limited license use. Please contact the appropriate vendor if you are not certain on how to transfer your licenses.</p>\n\n                            <p>We recommend beginning the deauthorization process within your iTunes. You will be able to navigate to the iTunes menu option \"Store\", and find the \"Deauthorize This Computer\" command. Once you have confirmed the prompts, and entered your Apple ID and password, Apple will proceed with the deauthorization and the rights to any music, apps, or other downloaded content will be released back to your account for use on another device.</p>\n\n                            <p>Next, if you have registered your device in the \"Find My Mac\" application, open System Preferences, then open iCloud, from there you should find the \"Find My Mac\" checkbox. Please make sure the \"Find My Mac\" checkbox is <strong><em>UNCHECKED</em></strong>.</p>\n\n                            <p>If you would prefer to leave the location tracking service provided by \"Find My Mac\" intact during shipping, we encourage you to do so. However, once the package is delivered to our facility our process will require that the device is removed from the application. This can be done simply by logging into iCloud (www.icloud.com), opening the application, and clicking the \"Devices\" button in the top left corner.
