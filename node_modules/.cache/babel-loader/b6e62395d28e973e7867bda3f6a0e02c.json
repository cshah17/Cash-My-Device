E-waste or electronics recycling is the process of recovering material from old devices to use in new products.Electronic waste, or e-waste, refers to any discarded products with a battery or plug. The biggest e-waste categories are small and large appliances and heating/cooling equipment.1 If not properly disposed of, e-waste is devastating to the environment, making recycling and recovery programs critical. Items that can be recovered from e-waste to prevent environmental damage include constituents such as plastics, metals, and glass.\n                </li> <br />\n                <li>\n                    ELECTRONIC RECYCLING ASSOCIATIONS:\n                </li><br />\n                <li>\n                    ISRI (the Institute of Recycling Industries): ISRI is the largest recycling industry association with 1600 member companies, of which 350 companies are e-waste recyclers.\n                </li><br />\n                <li>\n                    CAER (Coalition for American Electronics Recycling): CAER is another leading e-waste recycling industry association in the U.S. with over 130 member companies operating around 300 e-waste recycling facilities altogether throughout the country.\n                </li><br />\n                <li>\n                    EERA (European Electronics Recyclers Association): EERA is the leading e-waste recycling industry association in Europe.\n                </li><br />\n                <li>\n                    EPRA (Electronic Products Recycling Association): EPRA is the leading e-waste recycling industry association in Canada.\n                </li><br />\n                <li>\n                    THE COST OF ELECTRONICS:\n                </li><br />\n                <li>\n                    Producing a computer along with its monitor takes at least 1.5 tons of water, 48 pounds of chemicals, and 530 pounds of fossil fuels.\n                </li><br />\n                <li>\n                    Compared to disposal in landfills or by incinerators, reusing or recycling computers can create 296 more jobs per year for every 10,000 tons of computer waste processed.\n                </li><br />\n                <li>\n                    Only 20% of e-waste is documented to have been collected and recycled, despite high-value recoverable materials such as copper and gold.\n                </li><br />\n                <li>\n                    Americans throw away an estimated $55 billion in e-waste material annually (more than the 2019 Gross Domestic Product of many countries.)\n                </li><br />\n                <li>\n                    By recycling 1 million cell phones, more than 35,000 pounds of copper, 33 pounds of palladium, 772 pounds of silver, and 75 pounds of gold can be recovered.\n                </li><br />\n                <li>\n                    The excessive amount of lead in e-waste, if released into the environment, could cause severe damage to human blood and kidneys, as well as central and peripheral nervous systems.E-Waste Globally\n                </li><br />\n                <li>\n                    The amount of worldwide e-waste generation is expected to exceed 50 million tons by 2020, with an annual growth between 4% and 5%.\n                </li><br />\n                <li>\n                    This quantity includes 16.8 million metric tons of small equipment;
