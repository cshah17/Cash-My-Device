                    Data wiping is the process of logically removing data from a read/write medium so that it can no longer be read. Performed externally by physically connecting storage media to a hardware bulk-wiping device, or internally by booting a PC from a CD or network, it is a nondestructive process that enables the medium to be safely reused without loss of storage capacity or leakage of data.

                    Confidentiality is a matter of trust between a company and their clients. It is the responsibility of the company to ensure that the sensitive information they have collected never falls into the wrong hands. This threat becomes a heightened concern every time a company refreshes their technology or adds their excess inventory into the secondary market. But, by using secure data wiping, companies can effectively eliminate all of the sensitive data on their hard drives and other forms of recordable media while keeping the equipment suitable for resale or donation.

                    If you have an excess of IT assets that you are looking to sell off as part of an IT Asset Recovery strategy, secure data wiping is your best option for maintaining the privacy and security of your clients and customers while maximizing the value of your equipment on the secondary market.

                    According to the Department of Defense's data destruction guidelines as outlined in DoD 5220.22-M, secure data wiping consists of overwriting each sector of the disk no less than three times. The manner in which the process occurs is as follows:
                </li> <br />
                <li>
                    On the first pass, all of the data in each sector is replaced by a character
                </li> <br />
                <li>
                    On the second pass, each character is replaced by its complement
                </li> <br />
                <li>
                    On the third pass, each sector is then filled with a random character.

                    Data wiping is not one-size-fits-all. Thereâ€™s an array of types that your company can benefit from. The most frequently used types include a single pass overwrite, a three pass overwrite, a seven pass overwrite, and a secure erase.
                </li> <br />
                <li>
                    Each type involves a different process that is, for the most part, self-explanatory. For example, a single pass overwrite is when the data is written over once. Sometimes, regulations like HIPAA require certain data-wiping specifications for your industry, so make sure to check what is required for the type of data you are wiping.

                    In a nutshell, data wiping is a great, cost-effective solution to ridding your company of unneeded data without having to purchase additional hard drives. The money you have saved can then be allotted to other parts of your organization like new software, increased marketing efforts, or end-of-the-year bonuses

                    Data wiping is not something to take lightly. If you want your data to be protected, make sure you use an IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) company who follows NIST standards for their data wiping procedures and can provide a Certificate of Sanitization, backed by data security certifications like R2, e-Stewards or NAID. This ensures that the company in question safely disposes of all IT assets in a way that guarantees that your data will not be disclosed to a third party.
