                    Electronics waste, commonly known as e-scrap or e-waste, is the trash we generate from surplus, broken, and obsolete electronic devices. Electronics contains various toxic and hazardous chemicals and materials that are released into the environment if we do not dispose of them properly. E-waste or electronics recycling is the process of recovering material from old devices to use in new products.Electronic waste, or e-waste, refers to any discarded products with a battery or plug. The biggest e-waste categories are small and large appliances and heating/cooling equipment.1 If not properly disposed of, e-waste is devastating to the environment, making recycling and recovery programs critical. Items that can be recovered from e-waste to prevent environmental damage include constituents such as plastics, metals, and glass.

                <li>
                    Only 20% of e-waste is documented to have been collected and recycled, despite high-value recoverable materials such as copper and gold.

                    On a per capita average basis, each Japanese resident discarded 16.9 kilograms of e-waste, less than the USA and UK average levels (19.4 kg and 24.9 kg per person, respectively) but far above the Asian per capita average of 4.2 kg.
